Hi, I'm Sam! üëã

I love to write, code, and [teach](./talks). I also love constantly becoming a better version of myself.

I'm a developer, a developer advocate engineer for [Auth0](http://www.auth0.com), and an instructor for [Thinkster](http://www.thinkster.io) and [egghead](http://www.egghead.io). I live in the rural Pacific Northwest with my partner, three barn cats üêà, and 17 chickens. üêì

I'm using a lot of green on this site because two of my favorite things are forests and mint chocolate chip ice cream.

You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/samjulien) and hang out with me on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/samjulien).
