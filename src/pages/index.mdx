# Hi, I'm Sam! üëã

It's really nice to meet you. I'm a developer and writer living in Washington state with the love of my life and our scruffy doggo. I work as a Developer Advocate Engineer at [Auth0](http://www.auth0.com) and I'm also an instructor for [Thinkster](http://www.thinkster.io) and [egghead](http://www.egghead.io). I like writing code, studying consciousness, and being in the woods (especially by a fire). I'm a fellow crafter, a fellow enthusiast, a fellow fan (of you) &mdash; friend.

<div className="flex sm:flex-row flex-col -my-5">

My mission is to help those around me thrive by continually transforming into the best version of myself. I have a long way to go, but I'd love to exchange notes on what has and hasn't been working along the way. You know, swap pieces of the map we've each discovered.

This site is a combination of a bulletin board and a public journal. I write
here about what I'm learning in life and in my career.

My email list is a digital campfire. Campfires are where people are their most authentic.
Campfires are where you share a drink or a smoke or a sandwich or a poem or a story
and in between those less weighty subjects casually work in what's _really_ going
on in your life.

Pull up a chair, pour yourself a beverage, and let me know what's on your mind. Doesn't matter who you are, what you look like, or the number of stars you have on your GitHub.

If you'd like to talk closer to real time, you can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/samjulien) and [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/samjulien).
