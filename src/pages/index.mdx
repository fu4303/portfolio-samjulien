# Hi, I'm Sam! üëã

I love to write, code, and [teach](./talks). I am constantly striving becoming a better version of myself. Every day I want to be 1% better than I was yesterday.

I'm a developer, a developer advocate engineer for [Auth0](http://www.auth0.com), and an instructor for [Thinkster](http://www.thinkster.io) and [egghead](http://www.egghead.io). I live in the rural Pacific Northwest with my partner, three barn cats üêà, and 16 chickens. üêì I'm using a lot of green on this site because two of my favorite things are forests and mint chocolate chip ice cream.

I don't have a "rags to riches" story, but I do have a "broke, divorced, depressed insurance agent becomes sustainably happy self-taught developer" story. It took several years of tough self work and a lot of help along the way, and now one of my main passions is throwing open gates for others to be able to do the same. I am convinced that coding is one of the best ways for someone to completely alter their financial trajectory, regardless of who they are and what they look like.

If you're interested in coming along with me on this journey, sign up for my newsletter below. I send out what I'm learning and stories about my path as a self-taught developer with the hope that they will help others. You can also find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/samjulien) and hang out with me on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/samjulien).
