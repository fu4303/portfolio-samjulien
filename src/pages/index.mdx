# Hi, I'm Sam! 👋

I love to write, code, and [teach](./talks). I am constantly striving becoming a better version of myself. Every day I want to be 1% better than I was yesterday.

I'm a developer, a developer advocate engineer for [Auth0](http://www.auth0.com), and an instructor for [Thinkster](http://www.thinkster.io) and [egghead](http://www.egghead.io). I live in the rural Pacific Northwest with my partner, three barn cats 🐈, and 16 chickens. 🐓 I'm using a lot of green on this site because two of my favorite things are forests and mint chocolate chip ice cream.

I don't have a "rags to riches" story, but I do have a "broke, divorced,
depressed insurance agent becomes sustainably happy self-taught developer"
story. It took several years of tough self work and a lot of help along the
way, and now one of my main passions is throwing open gates for others to be
able to do the same. I am convinced that coding is one of the best ways for
someone to completely alter their financial trajectory, regardless of who
they are and what they look like.

I send out what I'm learning and stories about my path as a self-taught developer with the hope that they will help others.
