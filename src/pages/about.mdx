# Hi, I'm Sam.

Hi, I'm Sam Julien! I'm a software engineer, technical writer and teacher, and musician in Portland, Oregon. I work in C# and JavaScript (especially Angular) and write for [Auth0](http://www.auth0.com/blog). I'm also a [Google Developer Expert](https://developers.google.com/experts/people/sam-julien) and the main organizer of [Angular Portland](https://www.meetup.com/ngpdxers). When I'm not writing code, I'm learning something new like blacksmithing, woodworking, or welding. Otherwise, I'm on a hike somewhere in the Pacific Northwest. Sometimes I write about tech stuff here, other times I write about what I'm learning and experiencing.

I'm available for technical consulting and speaking/teaching. [Reach out to me on Twitter](http://twitter.com/samjulien) to start the conversation.
