# SamJulien.com

Hi, I'm Sam. This is the repo for migrating [my site](http://www.samjulien.com) from Ghost to Gatsby. A good chunk of it was done prior to adding source control and pushing it up to a repo, so I'll try to add references and links as time goes on in case you're starting from scratch.

This site is built using the [Egghead MDX Starter](https://github.com/eggheadio/gatsby-starter-egghead-blog) for [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/).

## Road to Production
Here's what I want to have done before officially switching over [samjulien.com](http://www.samjulien.com):
- Fix query and weird spacing in About page
- Fix static image and about image
- Combine Index with About page and update copy to include recent projects
- Add ConvertKit ID and key
- Modify CK form to have paths for both tech and non-tech subscribers
- Add content from 2019
- Update talks page to be current

## Post Production
- Move talks content to AirTable
