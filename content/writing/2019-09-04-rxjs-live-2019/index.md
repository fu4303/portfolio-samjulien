Thanks for joining Mike Ryan and I at [RxJS Live 2019](https://www.rxjs.live/)!

Here are the slides:

- [What Groups By in Vegas, Stays in Vegas](https://speakerdeck.com/samjulien/what-groups-by-in-vegas-stays-in-vegas)

And the sample code:

- [rxjs-groupby-basic](https://github.com/samjulien/rxjs-groupby-basic)

There's a branch for `mergeMap`, `concatMap`, and `switchMap` by themselves, as well as one for using `groupBy` and another to demonstrate how to extract a custom operator.
