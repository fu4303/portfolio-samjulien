If you're interested in learning to code, you might hear the term "full stack developer" used. What is a "stack," anyway? What does "full stack developer" mean? How do you become one?

## What does "full stack developer" mean?
The term "full stack" refers to all of the technologies that make up a web application.

A web application has the following parts:

- The frontend (or *client*): This is what you see in the browser when you load up a website. The frontend includes the design of the website and all of the functionality needed for the user to interact with it.
- The backend (or *server*): This is the computer where the website is running. The server also has a program that contains a set of instructions for what to do when the client asks for something. This is called an API (Application Programming Interface).
- The database: This is where all the information pertaining to the application is stored.

Let's imagine you were building a web application to track your collection of books.

- Your frontend would be the website where you would view your collection, add books, and remove them.
- Your backend would be the server that would know what to do when you tried to get, add, or remove books.
- Your database is where your book collection is stored. This way, every time you come back to the app, you don't have to re-enter all of your book information.

If you needed to delete a book from your collection, here's how it would happen in the stack:

- Frontend: You click the "delete book" button. The frontend sends a request to the backend that says, "Hey server, delete this book."
- Server: The server receives the request and says "Hey database, delete this book."
- Database: The database receives the instruction from the server and removes the book.

Typically, after the request to delete the book is successful, the database tells the server everything went fine, and the server relays that back to the frontend. The frontend will display a message to the user like a popup or a box that says, "The book was removed!"
