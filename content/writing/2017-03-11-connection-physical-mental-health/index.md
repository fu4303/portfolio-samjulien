*Note from Present Day Sam: While the things I talked about in this recording in 2017 really were transformative for me, I feel like I didn't do a good job of acknowledging that addressing deep depression needs the guidance of a doctor and often medication. You should know that even at the time of this recording I had seen many doctors and used many medications in my life, so please never interpret my experience as flippantly saying, "lol just exercise and meditate!" I don't take this lightly at all.*

In this recording, I talk about the hard-fought lessons I've learned over the years and the practices that have started producing actual results in my mental and physical health. My goal is to save you from some of the years of grinding away I've had to do due to my stubbornness.

## Notes!
**One key takeaway:** mental or emotional arguments require physical responses.

### 3 Physical Elements

1. Break the neural pattern physically.
2. Fully engage in the moment with something hard.
3. Take away your free will.

### 3 Mental Elements

1. Mindfulness develops the mind-body connection. Observation is the first step to change. Don't worry about the why, just pay close attention to how you are feeling physiologically.
2. Change in self-perception.
3. Gratitude and abundance.
