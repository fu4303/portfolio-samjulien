By request of [Dan Vega](https://twitter.com/therealdanvega), I did a [stream on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/samjulien) today on Keynote animation basics for developers.

Check out the video below. We cover:

- Magic Move, the #1 animation tool you'll want to learn
- Shape and image animation basics
- Text and code animation
- Various pro tips along the way that I've learned

Enjoy!

If you've got other topics you'd like me to teach and/or learn on Twitch, [hit me up on Twitter](https://twitter.com/samjulien).
